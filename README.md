# change-git-author-info-script-extended
This is a clone of the script, that changes the author info in a git repository. The original script can be found here: https://help.github.com/en/articles/changing-author-info - i made a minor adjustment to replace multiple users/emails in a single run.

1) Put the script in the root folder of your repo
2) Adjust the values of the variables `ARRAY_OF_OLD_EMAILS`, `CORRECT_NAME` and `CORRECT_EMAIL`
3) Run the script
